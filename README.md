# Hello this is Ishrat!

I'm an AI/ML engineer building agentic systems that connect multimodal understanding with real-world utility. My experience spans research and product: from deploying LLMs and RAG agents into production pipelines to exploring vision-language-action models for embodied AI. 
Currently, I focus on:

- Multimodal AI — integrating text, image, and sensor data for smarter perception and reasoning
- LLMs & NLP — finetuning and deploying language models in SaaS and vertical applications
- AI for healthcare — building robust, human-centered models for high-stakes domains
- Full-stack ML deployment — leveraging PyTorch, Hugging Face, vector DBs, Docker, and AWS
